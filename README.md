# EmployeeBurnOut
Python-based data analysis and machine learning initiative aimed at predicting employee burnout rates. 

Utilizing the Pandas library for data manipulation and visualization, the project conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering. A Linear Regression model is then built using Scikit-learn, incorporating AI/ML techniques to evaluate and predict burnout trends.
